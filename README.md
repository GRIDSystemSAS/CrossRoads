# CrossRoads
Laurent Sengmany's CrossRoad. 

CrossRoads is a task manager, inspired by Scrum and KanBan method, this application's aim is to manage your projects and schedule your to-do tasks. 

In it first version, it was mainly a proof of concept to build a cross platform application using Delphi's FMX. It use only Delphi XE2's technologies (FMX, animation, clientDataSet as persistance layer). The goal was to test newest Delphi technology (hey, back to 2012 !), and to test the crossplatform capabilities of the FMX framework.

Even today (2016+), it will a good exemple a well designed app using only Delphi tools.

*Laurent Sengmany* is the author of the whole app, included design and code.

# Project Status : 

- Original work is archived under *"CrossRoads_DelphiVER230_Original"* directoy. This one compiles under XE2, and it is the original project.
- You will find an *incomplete* port of CrossRoads under XE7 in the *"CrossRoads_DelphiVER280_Port"* directory. Due to the huge FMX evolution between XE2 (VER230) and XE7 (VER280) we had simply duplicate the project.
-  Note that the VER280 port compile under last delphi version (VER310)
- Note : we do not have plan for a futur version, dev on CrossRoad are over. If you fix XE7 version, we'll be please to plublish it here.
