It use only Delphi XE2's technologies (FMX, animation, clientDataSet as persistance layer). The goal was to test newest Delphi technology back in 2012, and to test the crossplatform captabilities of the framework.

Original work is archived under *"CrossRoads_DelphiVER230_Original"* directoy. This one compiles under XE2, and it is the original project.
You will find an *incomplete* port of CrossRoads under XE7 in the *"CrossRoads_DelphiVER280_Port"* directory. Due to the huge FMX evolution between XE2 (VER230) and XE7 (VER280) we had simply duplicate the project.
Note that the VER280 port compile under last delphi version (VER310)
The identify problem actualy is FMX component behaviour modification (such as ParentClipping)
